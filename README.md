:::INSTALL TROUBLESHOOTING:::

Q. What if the install is blocked by an admin?

A. You can also use the installer titled "Fujifilm Asset Update" (the icon is a white box with a green play icon). 


Q. Using launcher instead of installing.

A. You can also use the application launcher instead of downloading. However, the installed files will need to stay wherever they are (such as keeping them on the desktop.) A shortcut can be created to the application file, but you can't move the executable!
